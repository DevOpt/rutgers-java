a)
Let n be the initial variable "a".
All statements cost constant time, or "1".
From the second return statement, we see that the function calls upon itself again and again.
Until the a reaches "0" or its base case. In that case, it will return "0" instead of itself.
And therefore we see that this function requires O(n) time.

b)
Let n be the exponent of 10 of which the value can be divisble or multiplied by until the value is within 1 and 10.
We can see that this function calls upon itself "n" until the number reaches the range
while we treat all comparisons at constant time.
We therefore can state that this function takes O(n) time.
